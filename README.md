# DHTable2TransformationMatrix
This .m file deals with the DH Model in the book "Introduction to Robotics Mechanics and Control3rd" by J.J.Craig. We input the DH Kinematic Table. By this file, we will get the parameters in the Transformation Matrix which could be used to transform the coordinate from the final coordinate system to the base coordinate system.
